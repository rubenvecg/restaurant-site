<h1>About Us</h1>

<hr>

<p>Burger Shot (formerly The Burger Shot) is a chain of hamburger fast-food restaurants. The player can buy stocks from them in the Lcn-exchange.com website in Grand Theft Auto V&trade;.
The first appearance of Burger Shot (as "The Burger Shot") at the North Point Mall, Vice Point, Vice City in GTA Vice City&trade;.</p>

<img class="right-side" src="img/right-side.jpg" />

<p>It is a parody of American fast food chains Hardee's&trade; and Burger King&trade;. The name resembles Burger King&trade;, but the style of logo resembles Hardee's&trade;.
Burger Shot first appeared in the form of "The Burger Shot," a rudimentary restaurant in GTA Vice City (among many other less known outlets in the Game)
where the player can replenish their health if it is below 100 points. </p>

<p>The restaurant has risen in prominence in GTA San Andreas&trade;, where the restaurant becomes a large chain based in multiple locations. In addition to replenishing health, Burger Shot in GTA San Andreas&trade;
allows the player to eat from a range of set meals
in order to eliminate their hunger, or accumulate fat by eating fatty food. </p>


<p>While it is impossible to access Burger Shot outlets in GTA Chinatown Wars&trade;, players can obtain food prizes from Burger Shot in the form of fries or burgers for health by purchasing 
its scratch cards.</p>
